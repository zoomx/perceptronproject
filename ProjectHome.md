Perceptron Project is an interactive art project based on a grid of range sensors and a camera. The idea is to explore how physical movement be interpreted as music and visual imagery.

It relies heavily on the OpenCV libraries, and uses MaxMSP, Processing, with some additional Quartz Composer and Python additions.
