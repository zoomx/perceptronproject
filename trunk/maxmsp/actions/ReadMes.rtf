\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 BackwardDeltaVarThreshInt.maxpat 
\f1\b0 \
compares new value vs last value and outputs the backward difference if over the threshold.   Works only with int values, threshold can be changed on the fly.\
\
declarations: none\
inputs: new value, threshold\
outputs: delta value, bang on delta output\
\

\f0\b BackwardDeltaThreshInt.maxpat 
\f1\b0 \
compares new value vs last value and outputs the backward difference if over the threshold which is set at declaration.   Works only with int values.\
\
declarations: threshold\
inputs: new value\
outputs: delta value, bang on delta output\
\

\f0\b ClosedCountingGate.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
a closed gate that opens for the declared number \
of clock cycles provided in input 1.\
\
declarations: # of seconds to count\
inputs: bang to run counter, bang to open gate,  data to gate\
outputs: data when gate is open\
\

\f0\b ClosedSecCountingGate.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
a closed gate that opens for the declared number of seconds.\
\
declarations: # of seconds to count\
inputs: bang to open gate,  data to gate\
outputs: data when gate is open\
\

\f0\b ContinuousOutputCount.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
outputs a count of how often it's receive the same value in a row.\
a new value clears the count to 1.\
\
declarations: none\
inputs: value to count\
output: times in a row the input has been repeated.\
\

\f0\b DeltaThresholdStatic.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
Outputs the incoming value if greater than the declared threshold different than the last value.\
\
declarations: threshold size (int)\
inputs: int new value\
output: int new value if more than the threshold different than last value output\
\
\

\f0\b ForwardDeltaVarThreshInt.maxpat 
\f1\b0 \
compares new value vs last value and outputs the forward difference if over the threshold.   Works only with int values, threshold can be changed on the fly.\
\
declarations: none\
inputs: new value, threshold\
outputs: delta value, bang on delta output\
\
\

\f0\b ForwardDeltaThreshInt.maxpat 
\f1\b0 \
compares new value vs last value and outputs the forward difference if over the threshold which is set at declaration.   Works only with int values.\
\
declarations: threshold\
inputs: new value\
outputs: delta value, bang on delta output\
\
\

\f0\b OpenCountingGate.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
an open gate that closes for some number of bangs after data goes through.\
\
declarations: bangs to count,\
inputs:  bang to drive counter, data to gate (which also triggers closing of gate)\
outputs: data when gate is open\
\

\f0\b OpenSecCountingGate.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
an open gate that closes for some number of seconds after data goes through.\
\
declarations: seconds to count,\
inputs:  data to gate, which also triggers closing of gate\
outputs: data when gate is open\
\
\

\f0\b SamplePlayThresh.maxpat
\f1\b0 \
plays the declared sample, when data stream lowers more than the current threshold.\
Once the sample triggers it will not play again in until the patch receives the declared number of bangs.  Used to set the retrigger speed.\
\
declarations:  Delta Threshold, buffer name, sample file name, retrigger count\
inputs: bang to drive counter, int data stream to trigger sample\
outputs: audio from sample playback}
